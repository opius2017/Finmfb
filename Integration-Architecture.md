# FinTech Accounting Integration Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the integration architecture between the core accounting engine and other modules (Banking, Loans, Payroll, and Fixed Assets) within the FinTech platform. The integration follows an event-driven approach to maintain loose coupling between modules.

## Architecture Components

### Domain Events

Domain events are used to communicate state changes from operational modules to the accounting engine. Each domain event represents a business transaction that has accounting implications.

Key event categories:
- Banking Events (deposits, withdrawals, transfers, fees, interest)
- Loan Events (disbursements, repayments, write-offs, interest accruals)
- Payroll Events (salary payments, tax remittances, pension contributions)
- Fixed Asset Events (acquisitions, depreciation, disposals, revaluations)

### Integration Services

Integration services act as translators between operational modules and the accounting engine. They:
1. Receive domain events from operational modules
2. Interpret the business meaning of events
3. Create appropriate accounting journal entries
4. Handle special accounting rules specific to each module

### Event Handlers

Event handlers subscribe to domain events and route them to the appropriate integration service. They provide:
1. Logging of event processing
2. Error handling and retries
3. Decoupling between event publishers and consumers

## Implementation Details

### Domain Event Base Class

All domain events inherit from a base `DomainEvent` class that provides:
- Unique identifier
- Timestamp
- Other common event metadata

### Domain Event Publishing

Domain events are published through the `IDomainEventService` interface, which:
1. Locates appropriate handlers for each event
2. Invokes handlers asynchronously
3. Manages error handling and logging

### Integration Service Registration

Integration services are registered in the dependency injection container via the `IntegrationServiceRegistration` class.

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: Integration services should handle duplicate events gracefully
2. **Transactionality**: Journal entries should be created within transactions
3. **Error Handling**: Failed accounting entries should be logged for review
4. **Audit Trail**: Maintain clear references between operational transactions and accounting entries

## Example: Banking Transaction to Journal Entry

When a deposit is made in the Banking module:
1. `DepositCompletedEvent` is raised
2. `BankingEventHandler` processes the event
3. `BankingAccountingIntegrationService.ProcessDepositAsync()` is called
4. Journal entry is created with appropriate debits and credits
5. References to the original deposit are maintained for audit purposes
