# CI/CD and Deployment Infrastructure

This document outlines the Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Deployment infrastructure for the FinMFB banking application.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for FinMFB follows industry best practices for a secure, reliable, and efficient deployment process. The infrastructure consists of:

1. **GitHub Actions workflows** for automating build, test, and deployment
2. **Kubernetes manifests** for container orchestration across environments
3. **Docker containerization** for consistent deployments
4. **Security scanning and compliance checks** integrated into the pipeline

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Backend CI/CD (`.github/workflows/backend-ci-cd.yml`)

This workflow handles the .NET Core backend application:

- **Trigger**: On push to `main`, pull requests to `main`, or manual dispatch
- **Key Steps**:
  - Build .NET Core application
  - Run unit and integration tests
  - Perform security scanning with OWASP dependency check
  - Build and push Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
  - Deploy to appropriate environment based on branch/context

### Frontend CI/CD (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`)

This workflow handles the React/TypeScript frontend application:

- **Trigger**: On push to `main`, pull requests to `main`, or manual dispatch
- **Key Steps**:
  - Install Node.js dependencies
  - Run ESLint and TypeScript type checking
  - Run unit and integration tests
  - Build frontend assets
  - Build and push Docker image to GitHub Container Registry
  - Deploy to appropriate environment based on branch/context

### Main CI/CD Orchestration (`.github/workflows/main-ci-cd.yml`)

This workflow orchestrates the overall deployment process:

- **Trigger**: On successful completion of backend and frontend workflows
- **Key Steps**:
  - Apply Kubernetes manifests to target environment
  - Perform database migrations
  - Run smoke tests to verify deployment
  - Update deployment status and notify stakeholders

## Deployment Strategy

### Progressive Deployment

The CI/CD pipeline implements a progressive deployment strategy:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Automatically deployed on pushes to feature branches
   - Used for ongoing development and initial testing
   - Resources scaled for development needs

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Deployed after successful PR merges to main
   - Mirror of production for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
   - Used for final validation before production release

3. **Production Environment**:
   - Deployed through manual approval after staging validation
   - High-availability configuration with multiple replicas
   - Enhanced security policies and monitoring

### Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment failures, the system provides:

- **Automatic rollbacks** if health checks fail after deployment
- **Manual rollback** capabilities through GitHub Actions
- **Version tracking** for auditability and traceability

## Kubernetes Infrastructure

The application is deployed to Kubernetes clusters with:

- **Namespace isolation** between environments
- **Network policies** to restrict traffic flow
- **Resource quotas** to prevent resource contention
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** for handling variable loads
- **Persistent storage** for stateful components
- **Ingress controllers** for routing external traffic

## Security Measures

The CI/CD pipeline includes several security measures:

- **Dependency scanning** to identify vulnerable packages
- **Container scanning** to detect security issues in container images
- **Static code analysis** to find code vulnerabilities
- **Secret management** using Kubernetes secrets (placeholder values in repository)
- **Least privilege principle** in Kubernetes RBAC
- **Network isolation** through Kubernetes network policies

## Monitoring and Observability

The deployed application includes:

- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring service status
- **Prometheus metrics** for performance monitoring
- **Readiness/liveness probes** for container health
- **Centralized logging** configuration

## Getting Started

### Running the CI/CD Pipeline

1. **For feature development**:
   - Create a feature branch from `main`
   - Make changes and push to GitHub
   - CI/CD automatically deploys to development environment
   - Create a pull request to merge to `main`

2. **For staging deployment**:
   - Merge pull request to `main` after approval
   - CI/CD automatically deploys to staging environment

3. **For production deployment**:
   - Approve the deployment to production in GitHub Actions
   - Monitor deployment progress and verify success

### Manual Intervention

For operations requiring manual steps:

1. Use the GitHub Actions UI to trigger manual workflows
2. Connect to the Kubernetes cluster for troubleshooting:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n fintech-[environment] get pods
   kubectl -n fintech-[environment] logs [pod-name]
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. Always run tests locally before pushing changes
3. Follow the branching strategy (feature branches for development)
4. Add proper documentation for significant changes
5. Monitor deployment logs for potential issues

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Failed workflow**:
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for details
   - Verify test results and fix failing tests
   - Ensure Docker build completes successfully

2. **Failed deployment**:
   - Check Kubernetes pod status and logs
   - Verify network policies allow required communication
   - Check for resource constraints (CPU/memory limits)

3. **Application issues after deployment**:
   - Check application logs
   - Verify configuration and secrets are correctly applied
   - Compare with previous working version for changes
